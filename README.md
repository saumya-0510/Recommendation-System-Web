## Agile Methodology 

### What is Agile 

Agile is a development methodology adopted today in the software industry. Agile promotes teamwork, flexible procedures, and organizing teams. 

How I Incorporated Agile Methodology During the Development Cycle 

SCRUM is a subset of Agile, a framework for developing software. SCRUM takes advantage of different techniques to achieve goals in Agile. SCRUM promotes an iterative model where the planning is performed on a very short term. The basic time working unit is the sprint. SCRUM teams always reason in sprints and their planning is limited to sprints. 

- Sprint 1 (May 11): Sprint Planning, Research and Design - Researching about various recommendation topics and methods of implementation. After finalizing Python for making the recommendation system, I searched for tutorials, and documentation. I researched and read various research papers on Recommendation systems.  
- Sprint 2 (May 17):  The features analyzed as (Through charts and graphs): 

  * Analyzing locations with highest job vacancies 

  * Analyzing experienced required for various positions 

  * Most demanded degrees for jobs 

  * Relation between industries and Education 

  * Analyzing industries with highest number of jobs  

  * Analyzing the top skills required for jobs 

  * Making a function to search for jobs given certain inputs â€“ City, industry and experience 

- Sprint 3 (May 25):  

  * I have made a Resume Analyzer, which is able to extract skills of the person. 

  * I worked on 6 Machine Learning models for the recommendation. 

  * Created Word Clouds for each of the 7 classifications of career. 

  * It went through unit testing and integrated testing. 

  * I refined my search function as well as worked on the web-app.
